## ðŸ¤– Autonomous Operation

### Core Features

- **Multi-Server Scouting**: Automatically scans all accessible Discord servers
- **Smart Channel Selection**: Targets voice channels with 2-15 members for optimal recruitment
- **Natural Conversations**: AI-powered interactions that feel authentic
- **Strategic Timing**: Respects cooldowns and peak activity patterns

### Command Overview

### Phase 2: Automated Infiltration & Recruitment

1. **Automatic Channel Selection**

   - Joins the highest-scoring voice channel
   - Targets 3-8 member channels (sweet spot for engagement)

   - Maintains natural conversation flow
   - Shows genuine interest in participants' activities
   - Gradually builds rapport and community connection

   - Long enough to build connections, not overstay welcome
2. **Smart Rotation**

   - Automatically moves to next optimal target
   - Sets 2-hour cooldown per server to avoid detection
   - Prioritizes new servers over recently visited ones
